LDM Document Manager
====================
LDM Document Manager is a tool to easily copy and archive scanned documents.


##General
If you digitalize your documents with a scanner (with automatic document feeder) you get lots of image files. This tool helps you to organize these files by:

1.Renaming the files to a logical, understandable name

2.Copy them to a logical location

3.Auto number the files if there are multiple files for one document


After archiving the files you can view them in Windows Explorer. Using the preview option in Explorer makes it a perfect application to browse through your archived files.
